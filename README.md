### Jenkins fundementals

Jenkins is an open source automation server

Jenkins is the CD Orchestrator
 - Commit -> Build -> Test -> Stage -> Deploy -> Run

Cloudbees and the Jenkins community
 - Organizes Jenkins World and supports numerous Jenkins events

Continuous Integration(CI)
  - is the frequent, automatic integration of code, meaning, automatically tests all new and modified code with the master code

Continuous Delivery(CD)
 - ensures that the code is always ready to be deployed

Continuous Deployment
  - automatically deploys all the validated changes to production

#### Source Code Management (SCM)
  - is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. 

#### Types of testing 
  - Unit tests - test a small piece of code 
   - a function or method or command
  - Integration tests - Validate integration between multiple sub-systems
   - including external sub-systems like a database
  - Smoke tests - validates basic functions of the system
  - Functional tests - validate the normal software behavior against the expectations and requirements
  - Non-regression tests - validate that the system still produces the same end result
  - Acceptance tests - test the full product from the perspective of an end user cases
